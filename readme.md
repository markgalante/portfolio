### About
Above is a screenshot of the résumé I developed. All information is stored in JavaScript objects and nested in individual files. This information was imported to each component and used with the [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) hook that is provided by React. This assisted in preventing drilling props down, as I was doing initially.
